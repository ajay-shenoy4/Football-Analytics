# Football-Analytics

This code, FormationsFootball processes NFL play-by-play data, groups it by down, yards to go, and offense formation for both pass and run plays, and generates recommendations based on the user's input for down, defenders in the box, and yards to go. The recommendation includes the best offense formation and play type that has a high chance of gaining more yards than needed based on past plays. This code, Football2, loads NFL play-by-play data, processes it by filtering quarterback dropbacks, creates indicator variables for key features (e.g., down, pass location, pressure), trains an XGBoost model to predict pass completions, and evaluates its performance.
